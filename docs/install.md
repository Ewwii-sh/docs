# Installation

Installation is the most important step before using ewwii, and we have a user-friendly installer which will help you install ewwii/eiipm on Linux very easily.

Just run the following command and you are good to go!

```bash
curl -sSL https://ewwii-sh.github.io/install.sh | install.sh
```

:::info
You can also install eiipm through this installer, but it is up to your preference if you want to install packages from the ecosystem.

Also note that if you ever want to install eiipm, just run the same command and choose to install eiipm only.
:::

However, not all people may be able to use this installer simply beacause they are not using **Linux**. If you are one of those, then the recommended way of installing ewwii is compiling it from source.

Here is a step by step guide on compiling it from source: [Ewwii Getting Started Article](https://ewwii-sh.github.io/articles/en/getting_started/#building-from-source)
