# Getting Familiar

Before you start off with ewwii, let's get familiar with some things. We will talk about **ewwii**, **eiipm**, and the **ewwii ecosystem**.

## Ewwii: The Core

You will already be familiar with ewwii. It is the core widget system. Without this, the rest of the things that we will talk about has **no use**.

## Eiipm: The Package Manager

Ewwii has a package manager to manage packages and tools that you install from the ecosystem. It is named **eiipm**. It is part of the ewwii ecosystem made to steamline the process of installing things from the ecosystem.

If you want to install a library, a template, or a tool, this is your go-to choice.

## The ecosystem

Ewwii is built in a way through which it can be expanded by an ecosystem of tools, packages, and libraries. You can also use a package manager like eiipm to install things from the ewwii ecosystem.

You can checkout all the official tooling in the ecosystem here: [ewwii-sh.github.io/tools/](https://ewwii-sh.github.io/tools/)
