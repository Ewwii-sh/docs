Due to the extensible nature of ewwii, there are many documentations. Both for the core utilities and external tooling.

However, this creates friction which might frustrat users who are looking for quick answers.

To ensure that the user has access to all docs, we have this central `/docs` page which links to every other documentation of official tooling and core utilities.
